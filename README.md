# PORTABLE FAN

This repo contains the schematics and the components that I used to build this little portable fan. Additional future work could be the addition of some sort of PWM controller, which should allow to control the fan speed.

Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo8P7rzDw8k) of the original video from which I took the idea and STL file. 

With respect to the original STL file a hole has been added in the top part for allowing the addition of a ON-OFF switch. Also the slot for the battery LED has been moved 15 mm down and another small hole has been added later with a drill to allow the user oto press the micro button. The purpose of the micro button is to connect the LED battery indicator to the battery and see the battery level.
