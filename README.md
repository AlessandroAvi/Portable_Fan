# PORTABLE FAN

This repo contains the schematics and the components that I used to build this little portable fan. Additional future work could be the addition of some sort of PWM controller, which sould allow allow to control the fan speed.

Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo8P7rzDw8k) of the original video from which I took the idea and STL file.
